<h1>Introduction to CSS Grids</h1>
 
 **Overview**
Grids are two dimensional containers, unlike flexboxes. flexboxes are one dimensional. 






 **Common Terms and Terminologies**
 - Gutter: Gutter is the space between grid items in the grid
 - Grid Item: The grid container contains grid items.
 - Grid Line: is either a vertical or horizontal line that makes up the structure of the grid.
 - Grid cell: The smallest unit on a grid is reffered to as a Grid cell.
 - Rows: The grid row is the horizontal track of the grid.
 - Columns: The grid column is the vertical track of the grid.
 - Nested Grids: Self explanatory right?Grids in a grid. yeah grids in a grid are basically nested grids. 

 **Methods**
 Some methods in css grids you will need:
 - Repeat(): This method in grid is used in creating multiple columns, ie: splitting the grid container into columns according to the size or fraction specified.
 - Minmax(): Used to define the minumum height and maximum height of rows in grids, could probably be used to define width for columns as well, we'll see later.
 - Justify Items:
 - Aligh Items:
 - Justify Self:
 - Aligh Self:
 - Grid-template-columns:
 - Grid-auto-rows

 **Keynotes**
 - !! Before you can apply grid to a div or container you first have to set the display of the container to grid in your style. Just as it is done in the case of flexboxes.
 - Use fractions instead of percentages, will be convenient to use and you can better deal with margins and paddings.
